(Section 8)
NextJS App Optimizations

Optimize images (both from source code and user-uploaded)
using NextJS Image Component

recommended way to specify image size => sizes="10vw" == approx 10% of viewport width

image hosts (like Cloudinary) allow you to manipulate the image url (parameters) to trigger Cloudinary to generate multiple versions
of your image file (and cache them)

you can use quality (value between 1 and 100)
```
<Image loader={imageLoader} src={post.image} fill alt={post.title} quality={50}/>
```
You can read the docs of the cloud/image provider (eg. "Image Transformations for Developers" in Cloudinary docs)
